It was originally                        called Pasta Gianduja, but later changed the name to Nutella. Because cocoa nuts were in such                        short supply because of World War II rationing, Ferrero used hazelnuts to extend the                        chocolate supply. The first product was made into loaves instead of an actual spread,                        but because children would throw away the bread just to eat the Nutella, Ferrero made                        it into a spread.</p>                    <p>It was very popular because it was a cheap way of making something taste so good. Today,                        if used in moderation, is a great way to get children to eat their whole grain foods.                        There is even a national Nutella day which falls on February 5th of every year.</p>                </div>            </main>            <aside role="complementary">                <div>                    <h4>Additional info on Nutella:</h4>                    <a href="/public/portfolio/hazelnutty/info/ingredients.php" title="Ingredients of Nutella">Ingredients</a>                    <a href="/public/portfolio/hazelnutty/info/offbrands.php" title="Brands of Hazelnut Spread">Different Brands of Hazelnut Spread</a>                </div>            </aside>            <footer role="contentinfo">                <div>                    <?php include $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'].
