It is used as a spread for food items such as bread, fruits, and basically anything that goes well with chocolate. It is widely popular throughout 75 different countries, but in the United States, it is bought every 2.5 seconds. That is faster than people being born, which is every 8 seconds. </p>                    <p>Studies have shown also that all the nutella sold in the world every year can cover 1000 soccer fields. So far, chocolate hazelnut spread is used only for eating and nothing else. </p>                </div>            </main>            <aside role="complementary">                <div>                    <h4>Additional info on Nutella:</h4>                    <a href="/public/portfolio/hazelnutty/info/history.php">History of Nutella</a>                    <a href="/public/portfolio/hazelnutty/info/ingredients.php">Ingredients</a>                    <a href="/public/portfolio/hazelnutty/info/offbrands.php">Different Brands of Nutella</a>                </div>            </aside>            <footer role="contentinfo">                <div>                    <?php include $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'].
